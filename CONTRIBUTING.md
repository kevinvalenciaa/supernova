# Contributing to Supernova

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Supernova as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Follow the coding standards** outlined below.
3. **Add tests** if you've added code that should be tested.
4. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs.
5. **Ensure the test suite passes**.
6. **Make sure your code lints**.
7. **Issue that pull request**!

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supernova-ai
cd supernova-ai

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys to .env

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Ensure proper type definitions
- No `any` types without justification

### Code Style
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const fetchUserProfile = async (userId: string): Promise<UserProfile> => {
  // Implementation
};

// ‚ùå Avoid
const fetchProfile = (id: any) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Component Structure
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good component structure
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onAction: () => void;
}

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ title, onAction }) => {
  return (
    <div className="component-class">
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <button onClick={onAction}>Action</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### API Routes
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement error handling
- Validate input data
- Add rate limiting where appropriate

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for utilities and helpers
- Write integration tests for API routes
- Write component tests for UI components

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('ContentGenerator', () => {
  it('should generate personalized content', async () => {
    const result = await generateContent({
      idea: 'test idea',
      profile: mockProfile
    });
    
    expect(result).toHaveProperty('aRollScript');
    expect(result).toHaveProperty('bRollScript');
  });
});
```
